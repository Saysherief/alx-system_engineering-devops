#Command line for the win

##Background Context

CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

***N.B:*** It was so easy and fun to solve the challenge till the 2nd task. I had to read more resources starting from the last challenge (18th) of the second task. It's always good to solve challenging tasks to improve your knowledge and skills. There is more...it's not only 27 challenge. Have fun!
